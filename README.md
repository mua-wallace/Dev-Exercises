This repository is made of dev-challenging Exercises


## Cube Root of a number:
A cube root of a number x is a number y such that y\*y\*y = x.
Example: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so the cube root of 8 is 2.

Write a code to find the cube root of a number N  to a precision of 0.0001 without using any standard functions.

```
For example:
Input: 729
Output: 9

Input: 41
Output: 3.4482

Input: 2
Output: 1.2599
```


## Spaces-from-String:
In this challenge, user can remove space between a sentence.

Given a string as input, output it without spaces.

```
For example:
string = "ab c  d e fgh i  j kl mn  opqr  stuvwxyz"
result = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```


## Lab Number
A lab number is a number such that the square of any of its prime divisors is still one of its divisors.

```
For example:
Input: 8
Output: true (2 is a prime divisor of 8, and 2x2=4 is also a divisor of 8)

Input: 50
Output: true (5 is a prime divisor of 50, and 5x5=25 is also a divisor of 50)
```
