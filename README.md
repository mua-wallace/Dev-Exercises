# Dev-Exercises
This repository content dev-challenging Exercises  I have COMPLETED
### Below are challenges:

1. ## Cube Root of a number:
A cube root of a number x is a number y such that y\*y\*y = x.
Example: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so the cube root of 8 is 2.

Write a code to find the cube root of a number N  to a precision of 0.0001 without using any standard functions.

```
For example:
Input: 729
Output: 9

Input: 41
Output: 3.4482

Input: 2
Output: 1.2599
```


2. ## Spaces-from-String:
In this challenge, user can remove space between a sentence.

Given a string as input, output it without spaces.

```
For example:
string = "ab c  d e fgh i  j kl mn  opqr  stuvwxyz"
result = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```


3. ## Lab Number
A lab number is a number such that the square of any of its prime divisors is still one of its divisors.

```
For example:
Input: 8
Output: true (2 is a prime divisor of 8, and 2x2=4 is also a divisor of 8)

Input: 50
Output: true (5 is a prime divisor of 50, and 5x5=25 is also a divisor of 50)
```
Write a program to check if the user input is a Lab number or not.

4. ## password-validator
Password validator is a program that validates passwords to match specific rules. For example, the minimum length of the password must be eight characters long and it should have at least one uppercase letter in it. 

A valid password is the one that conforms to the following rules:

    * Minimum length is 5;
    * Maximum length is 10;
    * Should contain at least one number;
    * Should contain at least one special character (such as &, +, @, $, #, %, etc.);
    * Should not contain spaces.
    
```
Examples:
Input: "gettingitdone"
Output: false

Input: "John Doe"
Output: false

Input: "$mearn7"
Output: true

```
Write a program to checks if the user input is a valid password or not.



5. ## Scoring Points
Give a variable number of words, create a program to output the word with the maximum score, based on the following scoring system:
The score of a word is calculated based on its character values, according to this table:
e, a, i, o, n, r, t, l, s, u are equal 1 point
d, g 2 points
b, c, m, p 3 points
f, h, v, w, y 4 points
k 5 points
j, x 8 points
q, z 10 points
The max length of a word is 10 letters

```
For example:
input { "This",  "is", "a", "cool" , "Challenge" }
output : Challenge

```

6. ## Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture (also known as the Ulam conjecture or the Syracuse problem) is an unsolved mathematical problem, which is very easy to formulate:
* Take any natural number
* If it's even, half it, otherwise triple it and add one
* Repeat step 2. until you reach 4, 2, 1 sequence
* You will ALWAYS reach 1, eventually. Example


```
x = 17
17 * 3 + 1 = 52
52 / 2 = 26
26 / 2 = 13
13 * 3 + 1 = 40
40 / 2 = 20
20 / 2 = 10
10 / 2 = 5
5 * 3 + 1 = 16
16 / 2 = 8
8 / 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2
2 / 2 = 1
1 * 3 + 1 = 4
...
